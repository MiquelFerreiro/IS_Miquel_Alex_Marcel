INITIAL PROJECT STRUCTURE:
We created a scenario consisting of a moving sky background, across which certain balloons will appear. 
We added music and sound effects for the balloons. Initially, we selected a simple hand as a pointer for the player, but we later found a better asset. 
The numbers represent the current height of each player. Players need to reach a certain height in order to catch or pop the balloons, depending on their color.
Here are the references for the background video and hand pointer:

INTERMIEDATE ADVANCES OF THE PROJECT:

There has been added player feedback to help with balloon height recognition (hand/balloon superposition and balloon increasing size when popping)

Now balloons have movement and different types. Double type requires two players to pop and Leaking type randomly moves. Different collision boxes and interactions have been added (working on it)

Balloons now chase an objective placed at the center, which has a visual of a spaceship. Players must protect it from balloons. It has a rotating animation and visual/sound feedback when taking damage.

Currently there's a bug with balloon height movement, we're working on it.
